******** May 14, 1990.

This is the README file for the art2 simulator. There is a fairly
detailed man page (art2.n) that you can view with:
% nroff -man art2.n | more
The code should be portable to almost any UNIX machine. I have run it
on a number of SUN and IRIS workstations. You should be able to simply
type:
% make art2
and pretty soon you'll have the executable.

DISCLAIMERS:
The program is my own implementation of a particular version of ART2.
I do not make any claims to its validity, nor does the program in any
way have the official endorsement of the creators of the ART
architecture. The output format is very simple, and is meant to be
supplemented by users for their specific application.

I will gladly help out with any bugs in the original code, but I will
not be willing to help modify the code to suit particular
applications. The code has a minimal interface but I spent a lot of
time commenting it thoroughly so other people can change it.

This program is installed on our CNS cluster, so it may get updated
from time to time. I doubt very much if the code will change more
frequently than a couple times a year, so avoid asking for updates
every few weeks.

Feel free to redistribute, modify, or use this program as you see fit.
The program comes with absolutely no guarantees. If you make any
generally useful modifications, please send me mail. If you use the
program for publications or other official use, please include an
acknowledgement.
