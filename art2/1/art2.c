/******************************** art2 **************************************

This program is a simulation of the ART2 architecture. Done as simulation
assignment numbers 3&4 for CN550.  Oct. 23, 1989.
Revised for Assignment 4 on Nov. 4, 1989.
Cleaned up on Mar. 13, 1990.

NOTE: The architecture implemented here is based on the following article:

G. Carpenter and S. Grossberg (1987) ``ART 2: self-organization of
stable category recognition codes for analog input patterns.'' {\em
Applied OpticsL,\/ {\bf 26L, (23), 4919-4930.

The particular version implemented here is like that shown in figure
10. In addition, the F0 loop is made isomorphic to the F1 layer, i.e.,
it consists of two loops and not just one as shown in the figure. This
has the advantage of buffering the input from TD influence. The
equations change a little bit in some cases, but I tried to document
these changes in the code as needed. Note that the bottom loop is
referred to as F0, the two middle loops as F1, and the top loop as F2.
The learning rule used here is the slow learning rule, meaning that
weights are updated by integrating the appropriate differential
equation (eqs. 18 & 19 in the article). The fast learning rule is good
for theoretical analyses, but not very good for realistic
categorization, particularly with ART2.

There are some tricks to implementing the circuit: 1) Regardless of
what kind of learning you use (fast or slow), the node activations are
always assumed to be fast, i.e., you solve them at steady state.
However, this requires that the activation in the two loops of F1 be
iterated constantly as the LTM values are updated. This is because
changes in the Bottom-Up (BU) or Top-Down (TD) LTM traces will change
the steady state response of the F1 populations.  2) it is suggested
that every time a reset takes place at F2, all F1 and F0 nodes should
also be reset. This avoids reverberations from old patterns that can
badly deform new inputs. The ART3 architecture avoids this problem
altogether.

Note that in my simulation, I let the weights change at the end of
every iteration through F1. The alternative approach would be to
iterate through F1 until activation has settled, then change weights,
iterate F1 until it settles, then update weights, and so on. This is
simply my interpretation of the fact that the weights, albeit slower
than STM activations, are still only finitely slower than STM. The
effects are minor. Mostly what you see is that after learning has
stabilized for a given pattern, a subsequent presentation of the same
pattern will cause a slight transient shift in the weights. This is
because as the pattern is instated at the top node P of F1, it takes a
few cycles before the feedback loop amplifies it to its steady-state
value. However, because F2 and the LTM traces are continuously
updated, the Top-Down exepctation pattern is parallel to the vector P
(hence no reset takes place), but it expects a bigger amplitude. Hence
the weights drop slightly, and then grow back to their peak values as
the F1 loops settle down. The size of the "dip" will be a measure of
the relative rate of LTM and STM changes. If you make the LTM traces
update more slowly (by reducing the step size of integration), the dip
will be smaller, and vice versa.

Mar 27 note: I have gone ahead and changed the function update_Zs() to
use an equation that should avoid the "dip" problem. I found out that
under extreme conditions the other version could cause a reset during
learning, which is a BAD thing.

ABOUT THE OUTPUT: The output of this program is very crude. Basically I
left it wide open so users could make any changes they wanted to suit whatever
output viewing devices they have. I have placed comments were appropriate
to indicate good places for printing out data.
